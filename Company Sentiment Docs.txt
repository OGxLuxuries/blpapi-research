Sentiment Scores
News stories and social media (Twitter) posts generate company sentiment scores.

Scores may be positive (+1), negative (-1), or neutral (0) with an associated confidence score ε [0-100]. With access to the individual story sentiment and confidence scores, you can develop a wide range of custom aggregation methods, time horizons, and half-lives.

Metadata
Classification
Bloomberg supports two metadata classification methods:
Assigned: Classification before the story is published. This includes coding by editors, editor workflow tools,  and codes sent by contributors.
Derived: Bloomberg’s automated classification rules applied to the story after publication. Bloomberg classification rules are maintained by human editors with knowledge in specific verticals and languages. No statistical methods are used for derived-classification logic.
Taxonomy Files
Taxonomy files provide descriptive information regarding the metadata. They provide possible tags and tickers for stories and their place within the tree structure. Taxonomy files are available in machine-readable form, and you can download them using your Bloomberg Real-Time Data account.
News stories are tagged to news tickers, typically of the format X@Y, where X is the company ticker and Y is the exchange code. If an exchange suffix is not specified, it is a US ticker. A ticker ending in Z indicates a private company, which can be verified using the TradeStatus field in either text or XML format:
news_taxonomy_securities.txt
news_taxonomy_securities.xml
Topics
Topic Codes
Bloomberg provides unique topic codes that differentiate Bloomberg from its competitors:

Topic
Description
HOT
Captures the most important Bloomberg News headlines from around the globe. Assigned at the discretion of Bloomberg editors, HOT headlines reflect the newsworthiness of the item and its market-moving potential.
BNSCOOP

MNASCOOP
Captures news about Bloomberg News Scoops assigned when Bloomberg breaks a merger and acquisitions story.
EXCLUSIVE
Captures Bloomberg News exclusive stories.
HEADS
Captures stories pushed out with headlines based on their importance or urgency.
Company-Focused Topics

DIV
Dividends
LAWSUITS
Legal actions
TNM
Shareholdings
Note: Each of these topic codes has more granular child topic codes that may be relevant depending on your strategy and focus.

Sentiment Analytics
Methodology
Bloomberg bases sentiment models on supervised machine-learning methods such as support-vector machines, decision trees, and regression models.

Supervised learning is a methodology for machine learning in which models are built from training data for which correct classification is known. The data is based on a large curated set of documents categorized by expert human annotators as positive, negative or neutral from which a statistical model is built for each class.

This model is used to classify new documents using the probability estimates for class membership and various thresholds. Bloomberg performs the classification in real time upon the news story’s arrival and regularly updates its models to retain a high fidelity to changing market conditions.

To be scored, stories must meet certain filtering criteria, including length constraints (except for headlines), content type (wire, language, topics), and sufficient content relevant to each company ticker.

Bloomberg’s algorithms extract parts of a story that are pertinent to the company under consideration using text summarization methods and analyze the summary sentiment as well as sentiment of the news article as a whole. Bloomberg combines features from both the company-specific content and the article overall and evaluates the content using statistical machine-learning techniques to find the highest-probability class assignment. A novel agglomerative clustering technique provides statistically valid confidence estimates from Bloomberg’s ensemble of machine-learning methods, thus maintaining the distributive properties of its underlying models.

Specialized algorithms provide an indicator of company sentiment on social media (Twitter), which presents additional challenges that must be tackled to provide meaningful, statistically sound indicators.
